Build my own version of StringBuilder.

Review hash table & arraylist syntax in Java.
Make sure to articulate all the ways a problem can be solved and discuss tradeoffs when in an actual interview even if some ways seem silly or inferior. Can code the best one, but show you can think of multiple solutions.

Java- "import java.util.Arrays" to use array methods.
Java- Don't have to import Math.
Java- "import java.util.BitSet;" for bit array.
Java- must convert strings to char arrays to move values around. Costly so avoid if possible.

Python- "from bitarray import bitarray" to use bit array.
Python- "from BitVector import BitVector" can also be used.
Python- Have to "import math"
